# Rule: Cambridge Syllabus Accuracy

**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Enforcement**: All teaching and marking content

---

## Rule Statement

All educational content must match Cambridge International syllabi with 100% accuracy. No invented content, no paraphrasing that changes meaning.

## Why This Matters

Students' A-Level exam success depends on learning the correct content. Wrong content = exam failure = damaged futures.

## Verification Requirements

### Teaching Content
- Topic codes must match official syllabus
- Definitions must match Cambridge-approved textbooks
- Examples must be relevant to Economics 9708

### Marking Content
- Mark schemes must match official Cambridge criteria
- AO1/AO2/AO3 breakdowns must be accurate
- Mark allocations must match official papers

## Sources of Truth

1. Official Cambridge International syllabus PDFs
2. Cambridge-approved textbooks (Hodder, Cambridge University Press)
3. Official Cambridge past papers and mark schemes

## Prohibited

- Invented syllabus codes
- Made-up marking criteria
- Content from non-Cambridge curricula (IB, AQA, Edexcel)
