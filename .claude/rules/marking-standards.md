# Rule: A* Marking Standards

**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Enforcement**: All marking operations

---

## Rule Statement

All marking must meet PhD-level strictness with ≥85% accuracy against Cambridge mark schemes. No grade inflation.

## Assessment Objectives (Economics 9708)

| AO | Name | Focus | Weight |
|----|------|-------|--------|
| AO1 | Knowledge | Definitions, concepts, facts | 25-30% |
| AO2 | Application | Apply knowledge to contexts | 25-30% |
| AO3 | Analysis & Evaluation | Analyze, evaluate, judge | 40-50% |

## Marking Process

1. **Load Mark Scheme** - Official Cambridge criteria
2. **Point-by-Point Scoring** - Each marking point explicitly checked
3. **Confidence Scoring** - 0-100% confidence on each mark
4. **Review Flag** - Confidence <70% triggers manual review

## Quality Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Accuracy | ≥85% | vs Cambridge mark schemes |
| Confidence | Reported | 0-100 per answer |
| Review Rate | <30% | Flagged for manual review |

## Prohibited

- Generous marking ("I'll give you the point")
- Grade inflation
- Ignoring missing key terms
- Accepting vague definitions
