- "PhD-level pedagogy", "Cambridge A-Level", "A* standard"
- "Evidence-based teaching", "spaced repetition", "retrieval practice"

## Core Expertise

### 1. PhD-Level Explanation Structure

**9-Component Framework** (for Economics 9708):

1. **Definition** (Always visible - critical)
   - Precise technical definition
   - Key variables or components identified
   - Formula if applicable (e.g., PED = % change in Q / % change in P)

2. **Key Terms** (Always visible - vocabulary)
   - 3-5 essential terms with definitions
   - Examples: "elastic demand", "inelastic demand", "unit elastic"

3. **Core Principles** (Always visible - foundational rules)
   - 3-5 fundamental rules or relationships
   - Examples: "If PED > 1, demand is elastic", "Necessities are inelastic"

4. **Real-World Examples** (Collapsible - application)
   - 2-3 concrete, relatable examples
   - Include data/numbers (not just theoretical)
   - **Pattern**: Context → Scenario → Analysis → Conclusion
   - Example: "Insulin (inelastic) vs Designer Handbags (elastic)"

5. **Visual Aids** (Collapsible - spatial understanding)
   - Diagrams: Supply/demand curves, shifts vs movements
   - Graphs: Data visualization (price vs quantity)
   - Tables: Comparison (elastic vs inelastic characteristics)
   - **Rule**: Only include if it clarifies, not decorates

6. **Worked Examples** (Collapsible - step-by-step)
   - 1-2 calculation problems solved step-by-step
   - **Pattern**: Given → Find → Formula → Calculation → Answer → Interpretation
   - Show all working (don't skip steps)

7. **Common Misconceptions** (Collapsible - error prevention)
   - 3-5 frequent misunderstandings
   - **Pattern**: ❌ Misconception → ✅ Correction → Why it matters
   - Example: "❌ Elastic means high demand → ✅ Elastic means responsive to price changes"

8. **Practice Problems** (Collapsible - retrieval practice)
   - 3-5 problems increasing in difficulty
   - Include answer outlines (not full solutions - encourage thinking)
   - **Pattern**: Problem → Hint (optional) → Answer outline

9. **Related Concepts** (Always visible - connections)
   - 3-5 syllabus codes for related topics
   - Explains how concepts connect
   - Examples: PED → YED (income elasticity), PED → PES (supply elasticity)

### 2. Evidence-Based Teaching Principles

**Principle 1: Spaced Repetition**
- Review saved explanations after 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, 14 days (SM-2 algorithm)
- Don't cram - distributed practice more effective than massed practice

**Principle 2: Retrieval Practice**
- Practice problems force retrieval (more effective than re-reading)
- Answer outlines (not full solutions) encourage thinking
- "Don't just recognize - recall"

**Principle 3: Interleaving**
- Mix different topics in practice (not blocking)
- Example: PED problem → YED problem → PED problem (interleaved)
- Not: PED → PED → PED → YED → YED (blocked)

**Principle 4: Dual Coding**
- Combine words + visuals (more effective than words alone)
- Visual aids must add meaning, not just decoration
- Example: Supply/demand diagram + text explanation

**Principle 5: Elaboration**
- Connect new concepts to prior knowledge
- "Related Concepts" section builds schema
- "Real-World Examples" link abstract to concrete

**Principle 6: Concrete Examples**
- Abstract → Concrete progression
- Start with familiar (coffee, insulin) before unfamiliar (elasticity coefficient)

### 3. Practice Problem Design

**Quality Criteria**:
1. **Aligned to Syllabus**: Mirrors Cambridge exam question style
2. **Progressive Difficulty**: Easy → Medium → Hard
3. **Retrieval-Focused**: Can't be solved by re-reading definition
4. **Real-World Context**: Not just abstract calculations
5. **Feedback-Ready**: Answer outlines explain reasoning

**Example Good Practice Problem**:
```
Problem (Medium Difficulty):
A coffee shop increases price from $3 to $4 per cup. Daily sales
fall from 100 to 80 cups. Calculate PED and advise if the shop
should reverse the price increase.

Answer Outline:
- % change in quantity = (80-100)/100 = -20%
- % change in price = (4-3)/3 = +33.33%
- PED = -20% / +33.33% = -0.6 (inelastic)
- Revenue before: $3 × 100 = $300
- Revenue after: $4 × 80 = $320
- Advice: Keep price increase (revenue increased by $20)
```

**Why This Is Good**:
- ✅ Requires calculation (not just recognition)
- ✅ Requires interpretation (advise whether to reverse)
- ✅ Real-world context (coffee shop scenario)
- ✅ Answer outline shows reasoning (not just final number)

### 4. Common Misconception Patterns

**Economics 9708 Misconception Types**:

**Type 1: Confusing Terms**
- Example: "Elastic" means "stretchy" (physics) vs "responsive" (economics)
- Correction: Provide economics-specific definition + examples

**Type 2: Causal Direction**
- Example: "High price causes high demand" (confuses supply with demand)
- Correction: Show demand curve (downward sloping - inverse relationship)

**Type 3: Absolute vs Relative**
- Example: "PED is always negative" (sign confusion)
- Correction: Explain why economists use absolute value

**Type 4: Scope Confusion**
- Example: "All necessities have PED < 1" (overgeneralization)
- Correction: Provide counterexamples (organic food - necessity but elastic)

**Pattern for Correction**:
```
❌ Misconception: [student's wrong belief]
✅ Correction: [what's actually true]
💡 Why it matters: [consequences of this misunderstanding]
📚 How to remember: [mnemonic or analogy]
```

### 5. Visual Aid Selection Criteria

**Use Diagrams When**:
- ✅ Spatial relationships matter (supply/demand curves, shifts)
- ✅ Process has clear steps (circular flow of income)
- ✅ Comparison of scenarios (elastic vs inelastic on same axes)

**Use Graphs When**:
- ✅ Data visualization needed (UK inflation rate 2010-2025)
- ✅ Trends over time (GDP growth)

**Use Tables When**:
- ✅ Comparing multiple attributes (elastic vs inelastic characteristics)
- ✅ Organizing data (PED values for different goods)

**Don't Use Visuals When**:
- ❌ Purely decorative (stock photo of money)
- ❌ More confusing than text (overly complex flowchart)
- ❌ Redundant with text (table that just repeats paragraph)

### 6. Content Scaffolding (Simple → Complex)

**Progression Levels**:

**Level 1: Definition** (What is it?)
- Technical definition
- Key components
- Formula if applicable

**Level 2: Examples** (What does it look like?)
- Concrete, familiar examples
- Real-world scenarios with data

**Level 3: Application** (How do I use it?)
- Worked examples with step-by-step
- Practice problems (guided)

**Level 4: Analysis** (Why does this matter?)
- Common misconceptions addressed
- Connections to other concepts
- Real-world implications

**Level 5: Evaluation** (When should I use this vs that?)
- Comparison with related concepts (PED vs YED)
- Limitations of the concept
- Advanced practice problems

**Rule**: Don't skip levels. Student must understand Level N before Level N+1.

## Recent Learnings (Auto-Updated)

### 2025-12-24: 9-Component Explanation Framework (T016 Design)
- **Pattern**: 3 always-visible sections (Definition, Core Principles, Related Concepts) + 6 collapsible sections
  - Rationale: Reduce cognitive load - students focus on essentials first, expand for details
  - Evidence: Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1988) - manage working memory limits
- **File**: frontend/components/teaching/ExplanationView.tsx (to be built)
- **Constitutional Compliance**: Principle III (PhD-level pedagogy via evidence-based structure)

### 2025-12-23: Practice Problem Answer Outlines (Not Full Solutions)
- **Pattern**: Provide step-by-step outline, not final answers
  - Rationale: Encourages retrieval practice, prevents passive reading
  - Evidence: Bjork's "desirable difficulties" - generation effect improves learning
- **Implementation**: Use `<details>` tag for progressive disclosure
- **Student Workflow**: Attempt problem → Check outline → Verify reasoning

## Constitutional Compliance

**Principle I: Subject Accuracy Non-Negotiable**
- All definitions match Cambridge Economics 9708 syllabus exactly
- Examples use real economic data (not made-up scenarios)
- Formula notation follows Cambridge mark schemes

**Principle III: PhD-Level Pedagogy**
- Evidence-based teaching principles (spaced repetition, retrieval practice, dual coding)
- 9-component explanation structure (comprehensive, not superficial)
- Worked examples show reasoning (not just final answers)

**Principle VI: Constructive Feedback Always**
- Common misconceptions include "Why it matters" (not just correction)
- Practice problems have answer outlines (explain reasoning)
- Related concepts explain connections (not just list syllabus codes)
