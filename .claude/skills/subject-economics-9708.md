## Paper Structure

**Paper 1: Multiple Choice** (30 marks, 1 hour)
- 30 questions × 1 mark each
- Tests AO1 primarily

**Paper 2: Data Response** (40 marks, 1.5 hours)
- Section A: 2 compulsory questions (20 marks each)
- Tests AO1, AO2, AO3

**Paper 3: Essay** (40 marks, 1.5 hours)
- Choose 2 from 6 questions
- 20 marks each
- Tests all AOs, emphasis on AO3

## Common Question Types

### Type 1: Definition (2-4 marks, AO1)
**Example**: "Define 'price elasticity of demand'"
**A* Answer**:
- Precise definition
- Mathematical formula if applicable
- Brief example

### Type 2: Explanation (4-6 marks, AO1+AO2)
**Example**: "Explain how a subsidy affects market equilibrium"
**A* Answer**:
- Clear explanation with diagram
- Reference to supply/demand curves
- Explain shift and new equilibrium
- Real-world example

### Type 3: Analysis (8-10 marks, AO1+AO2+AO3)
**Example**: "Analyze the effect of minimum wage on unemployment"
**A* Answer**:
- Define concepts
- Diagram with clear labels
- Chain of reasoning (cause → effect → consequence)
- Consider short-run vs. long-run
- Acknowledge assumptions

### Type 4: Evaluation (12-15 marks, All AOs)
**Example**: "Evaluate whether a government should increase taxes on demerit goods"
**A* Answer**:
- Arguments FOR (3-4 points with analysis)
- Arguments AGAINST (3-4 points with analysis)
- Depends on factors (elasticity, government priorities, alternatives)
- Reasoned judgment with justification
- Consider stakeholders

## Key Topics (2023-2025 Syllabus)

**Microeconomics**:
- Price system and resource allocation
- Supply and demand
- Elasticity (PED, YED, XED, PES)
- Market failure (externalities, public goods, merit/demerit goods)
- Government intervention
- Market structures (perfect competition, monopoly, oligopoly)

**Macroeconomics**:
- National income and GDP
- Unemployment and inflation
- Fiscal policy and monetary policy
- Balance of payments
- Exchange rates
- Economic growth and development

## Diagram Requirements

**Essential Diagrams**:
1. Supply and demand (shifts vs. movements)
2. Elasticity (steep vs. shallow curves)
3. Externalities (MSB, MPB, MSC, MPC)
4. Market structures (revenue curves)
5. AD-AS (aggregate demand/supply)
6. Phillips curve
7. Production possibilities frontier

**A* Diagram Standards**:
- Labeled axes (price, quantity, etc.)
- Labeled curves (S, D, S1, D1)
- Equilibrium points marked (E, E1)
- Arrows showing shifts
- Shaded areas where relevant
- Brief explanation of diagram

## Marking Scheme Pattern

**8-Mark Question** (e.g., "Explain the effect of..."):
- Knowledge (2 marks): Correct definitions
- Application (2 marks): Relevant to scenario
- Analysis (4 marks): Chain of reasoning with diagram

**12-Mark Question** (e.g., "Discuss whether..."):
- Knowledge (2 marks)
- Application (2 marks)
- Analysis (4 marks): Arguments on both sides
- Evaluation (4 marks): Reasoned judgment

**25-Mark Essay**:
- Knowledge (5 marks): Range of concepts
- Application (5 marks): Real-world examples
- Analysis (7 marks): Depth of reasoning
- Evaluation (8 marks): Balance, judgment, alternatives

## A* Standard Checklist

**Knowledge**:
- [ ] Precise definitions
- [ ] Correct economic terminology
- [ ] Accurate theory explanation

**Application**:
- [ ] Relevant real-world examples
- [ ] Clear link to question context
- [ ] Appropriate data/evidence used

**Analysis**:
- [ ] Diagram present and correct
- [ ] Clear chain of reasoning (X causes Y because Z)
- [ ] Short-run AND long-run considered
- [ ] Assumptions stated

**Evaluation**:
- [ ] Arguments on BOTH sides
- [ ] Significance/importance weighed
- [ ] "Depends on" factors identified
- [ ] Reasoned judgment with justification
- [ ] Alternative viewpoints considered

## Common Student Errors

❌ **Describing instead of analyzing**: "The price will increase" (Level 1)
✅ **Analyzing with reasoning**: "The price will increase because demand exceeds supply, causing upward pressure on price until a new equilibrium is reached" (Level 3)

❌ **No diagram**: Missing visual representation
✅ **Clear diagram**: Labeled diagram with explanation

❌ **One-sided evaluation**: Only benefits OR only costs
✅ **Balanced evaluation**: Both sides + judgment

❌ **Generic examples**: "In many countries..."
✅ **Specific examples**: "In the UK during 2020, inflation rose to..."

## Grade Boundaries (Typical)

**A*** = 90%+ of total marks (rare - requires exceptional AO3)
**A** = 80-89%
**B** = 70-79%
**C** = 60-69%

## Usage Frequency
**Used:** 0 times (Phase III not started)
**Will Use:** Every Phase III marking task (50+ times)
**Critical:** MVP subject - entire Phase III depends on this

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Last Updated**: 2025-12-18
