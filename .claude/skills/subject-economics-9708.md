### Section 4: The Macroeconomy

**4.1 Aggregate Demand (AD)**
- AD = C + I + G + (X - M)
- Consumption (C): function of disposable income, interest rates, wealth
- Investment (I): function of interest rates, business confidence, expected returns
- Government spending (G): fiscal policy instrument
- Net exports (X - M): function of exchange rate, relative inflation

**4.2 Aggregate Supply (AS)**
- Short-run AS: upward sloping (sticky wages)
- Long-run AS: vertical at full employment output (classical view)
- Shifts: productivity, technology, labor market changes

**4.3 National Income Determination**
- Equilibrium: AD = AS
- Multiplier effect: initial injection leads to larger final increase in national income
- Multiplier formula: k = 1 / (1 - MPC) or 1 / (MPS + MPT + MPM)

- Contractionary fiscal policy: decrease G or increase T → shift AD left
- Budget deficit vs surplus vs balanced

**5.2 Monetary Policy**
- Central bank controls money supply and interest rates
- Expansionary monetary policy: lower interest rates → increase AD
- Contractionary monetary policy: raise interest rates → decrease AD
- Quantitative easing (QE): central bank buys government bonds

**5.3 Supply-Side Policies**
- Policies to shift LRAS right (increase potential output)
- Examples: education/training, infrastructure, deregulation, lower corporate taxes
- Market-based vs interventionist

## Key Diagrams (Must Know)

### 1. Supply and Demand
- Axes: Price (Y), Quantity (X)
- Demand curve: downward sloping
- Supply curve: upward sloping
- Equilibrium: intersection point
- Shifts: entire curve moves left/right

### 2. Elasticity and Tax Incidence
- Inelastic demand: steeper curve, consumers bear most tax
- Elastic demand: flatter curve, producers bear most tax
- PED = 0: perfectly inelastic (vertical)
- PED = ∞: perfectly elastic (horizontal)

### 3. Market Structures
- Perfect competition: P = MC = AR = MR at long-run equilibrium, normal profit
- Monopoly: P > MC, produces where MR = MC, supernormal profit possible
- Diagram shows deadweight loss (welfare loss from underproduction)

### 4. Externalities
- Negative externality (production): MSC > MPC, overproduction
- Positive externality (consumption): MSB > MPB, underconsumption
- Welfare loss shown as triangle

### 5. AD/AS Model
- AD curve: downward sloping (real balance, interest rate, trade effects)
- SRAS curve: upward sloping
- LRAS curve: vertical at full employment (Yfe)
- Shifts in AD: monetary/fiscal policy
- Shifts in AS: supply shocks, productivity changes

### 6. Production Possibility Curve (PPC)
- Concave curve showing maximum production combinations
- Points on curve: productive efficiency
- Points inside curve: inefficiency
- Points outside curve: unattainable (currently)
- Shift outward: economic growth

## Common Student Errors (Marker Agent Must Catch)

### Error 1: Confusing Shifts and Movements
❌ "Increase in price causes supply curve to shift right"
✅ "Increase in price causes movement along supply curve (extension)"

### Error 2: Missing Diagram Labels
❌ Drawing curves without labeling axes, equilibrium, or shifts
✅ All diagrams must have: axes labels, curve labels, equilibrium points, relevant shifts marked

### Error 3: One-Sided Evaluation
❌ "Minimum wage is bad because it causes unemployment" (only negatives)
✅ "Depends on elasticity of labor demand. If inelastic, minimal unemployment; if elastic, significant job losses..."

### Error 4: Circular Definitions
❌ "Inflation is when prices inflate"
✅ "Inflation is sustained increase in general price level over time"

### Error 5: Confusing Nominal and Real
❌ "GDP increased 5% so economy grew 5%"
✅ "Nominal GDP increased 5%, but if inflation was 3%, real GDP growth was only ~2%"

## A* Model Answer Exemplar

**Question**: Evaluate the view that a minimum wage will always reduce poverty. (25 marks)

**A* Answer**:
"The effectiveness of minimum wage in reducing poverty depends primarily on the elasticity of labor demand and employment effects. If labor demand is inelastic (PED < 1), employers cannot easily reduce hiring or substitute capital for labor. In this scenario, most low-wage workers retain employment at the higher wage, increasing their income and reducing poverty. Evidence from the UK (2016-2020) shows minimal unemployment impact in sectors with high switching costs.

However, if labor demand is elastic (PED > 1)—common in competitive sectors like hospitality with low barriers to automation—firms respond to wage increases by laying off workers or accelerating automation. The unemployment created may offset income gains for those who remain employed. Empirical studies (Card & Krueger, 1994; Neumark & Wascher, 2007) show mixed results depending on sector and wage level.

Additionally, minimum wage only helps the employed poor. It does not address poverty among the unemployed, elderly, or those outside the labor market. A comprehensive anti-poverty strategy requires complementary policies: in-work benefits (EITC), job training, and social safety nets.

Furthermore, effectiveness depends on the level set. A minimum wage slightly above market equilibrium has minimal unemployment effects while lifting incomes. However, if set significantly above equilibrium (e.g., 2× median wage), unemployment effects dominate, potentially increasing poverty.

In conclusion, minimum wage can reduce poverty in sectors with inelastic labor demand and moderate wage increases, as seen in developed economies with strong enforcement. However, it is not a universal solution and may harm employment in elastic sectors or if set too high. Optimal poverty reduction likely requires minimum wage combined with targeted transfers and active labor market policies."

**Why A***:
- Balanced: considers both positive (inelastic demand) and negative (elastic demand) scenarios
- Evidence: cites real-world data (UK, Card & Krueger)
- Economic criteria: uses elasticity as analytical framework
- Perceptive: notes minimum wage doesn't help non-employed poor
- Qualified conclusion: "depends on... works when... fails when..."
- Comprehensive: 350 words, covers multiple dimensions
