# Skill: PhD Pedagogy (Constructive Feedback)

**Type**: Teaching Methodology
**Created**: 2025-12-18
**Domain**: Educational Feedback
**Parent Agent**: 06-AI-Pedagogy

## Overview
PhD-level teaching feedback that explains WHY and HOW, using Socratic method and deep explanation.

## Constitutional Requirement
**Principle VI**: Feedback is Constructive and Detailed - Always explain WHY wrong and HOW to improve.

## Feedback Structure (MANDATORY)

### 1. Score Context
```markdown
## Score: [marks_awarded] / [max_marks] (Grade: [grade])
```

### 2. Why This Score (Explain Reasoning)
```markdown
### Why This Score:
**What was good:**
- You correctly identified [X]
- Your diagram showed [Y]
- You applied the concept of [Z] effectively

**What was missing/incorrect:**
- The analysis lacked [depth/chain of reasoning/consideration of...]
- The evaluation was one-sided (only benefits, not costs)
- The example was generic rather than specific
```

### 3. How to Improve to A* (Actionable Steps)
```markdown
### How to Reach A* Standard:
1. **Deepen your analysis**: Instead of "price increases," explain WHY (demand exceeds supply, creating upward pressure until new equilibrium)

2. **Add diagrams**: Include a supply/demand diagram with:
   - Labeled axes (P and Q)
   - S and D curves clearly marked
   - E and E1 equilibrium points
   - Arrows showing shifts

3. **Balance your evaluation**: Consider BOTH:
   - Arguments FOR: [benefit 1], [benefit 2], [benefit 3]
   - Arguments AGAINST: [cost 1], [cost 2], [cost 3]

4. **Make specific examples**: Instead of "in many countries," use "In the UK during 2020, inflation rose to 2.5% due to..."

5. **Add "it depends on"**: Consider elasticity, time period, government priorities
```

### 4. Model Answer (A* Standard)
```markdown
### Model Answer Demonstrating A* Quality:

[Rewrite the student's answer to show what A* looks like]

**Notice how this answer:**
- Uses precise terminology
- Includes a labeled diagram
- Develops chains of reasoning (X → Y → Z)
- Considers both sides before judgment
- Uses specific examples with data
```

### 5. Specific Weaknesses with Remediation
```markdown
### Weaknesses Identified:
- **insufficient_evaluation**: You only considered benefits. Add 2-3 counterarguments.
- **lacks_diagram**: Include a diagram to visualize shifts in supply/demand.
- **weak_conclusion**: State your judgment clearly ("On balance, I argue that...because...")
```

## Tone Guidelines

### ✅ DO: Encouraging but Rigorous
```
"Your analysis of elasticity was sound, showing clear understanding. To reach A*, develop this further by..."
```

### ❌ DON'T: Generic or Harsh
```
"Wrong. Try harder."  // Too harsh, not constructive
"Good job!"           // Too vague, not helpful
```

### ✅ DO: Specific and Actionable
```
"Your diagram was missing labeled equilibrium points (E and E1). Add these to show the shift from old to new equilibrium."
```

### ❌ DON'T: Vague
```
"Your diagram needs improvement."  // What exactly?
```

## Socratic Method (Question-Based Learning)

Instead of telling the answer, guide with questions:
```markdown
### Reflection Questions to Deepen Understanding:
1. Why might demand elasticity affect the outcome?
2. What happens to producer surplus when price rises?
3. How might the government's policy differ in the short-run vs. long-run?
4. Which stakeholders benefit and which lose from this policy?
```

## Personalized Improvement Plan

```markdown
### Your Personalized Focus Areas:
Based on your last 5 attempts, work on:
1. **Evaluation skills** (weakest area - 60% vs 90% needed)
   - Practice: Write 3 evaluation paragraphs daily
   - Template: "On one hand... On the other hand... On balance..."

2. **Diagram accuracy** (70% vs 90% needed)
   - Practice: Draw 5 diagrams daily with full labels
   - Check: Are all curves labeled? Are equilibrium points marked?

3. **Specific examples** (already strong - maintain)
   - Keep using: Real countries, dates, data
```

## Constitutional Compliance

**Principle VI**: Feedback is Constructive and Detailed
- ✅ Explains WHY something is wrong
- ✅ Shows HOW to improve
- ✅ Provides model answer
- ✅ Identifies specific weaknesses
- ✅ Creates actionable improvement plan

**Principle II**: A* Standard Always
- ✅ Feedback is itself PhD-level quality
- ✅ No "just try harder" generic advice
- ✅ Deep explanation, Socratic questioning

**Usage:** 0 times (Phase III not started)
**Will Use:** Every feedback generation (50+ times)
